I noticed big companies loves to test with this coding problems.
Last time I apply for Amazon they give me 30 minutes to solve a hard problem.

I'm a slow thinker, so I decided to training my self in what the industry wants.

My goal its to resolve one problem each 2-3 days until I can solve a hard problem in 30 minutes or less.
