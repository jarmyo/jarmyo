I noticed big companies loves to test with this coding problems.

Last time I apply for Amazon they give me 30 minutes to solve a hard problem.
I'm a slow thinker, for this reason I decided to training my self in what the industry wants.
My primary goal for this project is to resolve one problem each 2-3 days until I can solve a hard problem in 30 minutes or less.

I will try to explain every problem as posible.
