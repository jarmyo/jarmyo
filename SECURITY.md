# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I have just one main branch that is deployed to the site.
Maybe in the future I cant implement a beta and dev brach to test first the code.

| Branch  | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| beta    | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just send a mail to jarm.yo@gmail.com with subject "Vulnerability" to report any kind of exploit or security leak.

I will try to resolve as soon as posible
